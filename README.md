Summary
======================

Tableau Extract Output component for Talend Data Integration suite. Works with both opensource and commercial version.


What it is?
======================
The year ending is near, so I have some time to play with my favorite applications like Tableau. Last week one of my 
(hopefully to be) client asked me how to report SAP R3/ECC6 tables with tableau - which is unfortunately not supported 
yet. I had an idea: why not integrate the tableau extract engine with an ETL tool, which has connectors for hundreds 
of source system including SAP ERP. I picked Talend ETL because it is free (at least it has a free version without 
limitation of source systems) and I made this new TableauExtractOutput component. With this, you can extract data 
from any kind of databases including mainframes, custom web services and so on without coding - just with a few clicks.

What else do I need?
======================

Talend DI 5.4+ from www.talend.com
Tableau 8 extract API from www.tableausoftware.com
Windows 64bit + Java 64bit
